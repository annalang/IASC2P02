<p> Hello! My name is Anna Lang. I am currently in my second year of Interactive Arts and Sciences at Brock University. I am in my third year here at Brock but took a year of Business Communication. I wanted a more creative program so switched at the beginning of my second year. </p> 

<p> I also run my own business designing and printing apparel from my home. This is something that I very much enjoy and would like to continue after I finish school. I have inserted a picture of my Logo </p>
