					Enigma was marketed as the first widespread use of electromechanical device that automated the encryption and decryption process. While the encryption algorithm was not revolutionary the machine that made the process of encrypting and decrypting information was accelerated and allowed a this code and machine to be revolutionary. this machine had more than one iteration that further increase the difficulty of the code.

				<section data-background="teal">
					While the Enigma Machine it is almost no longer important. Today insiders are usually used to protect data and it has become you to impossible to break these encryption. when you look at how to break an encryption the way that the British broke the Enigma Machine will no longer work. That form of decoding is using brute force to you search through all the possible availabilities and find the code. However with the use of current technology the amount of characters and possibilities having increased exponentially causing this type of decryption to no longer be possible.

				<section data-background="teal">
					 This means that the Enigma Machine could almost be considered as dead media. As it is not something that we use consistently use within our daily life these days. I think the while this is know as he used every day we can see reflection of it within the technology we do use. Something as simple as our iPhone is a great reflection of how the Enigma Machine has positively impacted our society and allowed us to create new and better technology.

					 I can personally see connection between even the Enigma machine and the lock on the iPhone. While it does not have the consistently turning rotors that make each letter different as it cycles through its rotation it is a complex code that can use the entire alphabet (including numbers and punctuation) or just the numbers 0-9.  These are similar due to the amount of combination that could occur which makes the device much harder to get into.
				</section>
				
				<section data-background="">
					Furthermore when looking at an iPhone and its password protection the iPhone has increased this technology to give the user a certain amount of tries and then locking it for a certain amount of time. When looking at the Enigma machine this is similar to the reset at midnight has it doesn't always allow the user to remember what codes they've tried and any codes they use again will also not work.
