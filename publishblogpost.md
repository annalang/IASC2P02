<p> The use of traditional visualization techniques is used to allow viewers of humanistic information to comprehend large amounts of information in a short time.  However, to display information associated with humanistic studies using traditional tools leads to inaccurate and false assumptions and does not display the full extent of the information.  Using traditional visualization techniques, the viewer applies scientific preconceived assumptions about the information.  Within the digital humanities, we must adjust the traditional visualization techniques in order to support the humanistic interpretation that information being studied is situational, partial, and influx and should not simply be viewed as pre-existing facts. </p> <p>
	Since the majority of these visualizations that the members of the digital humanities community use are taken from science they are being produced with the assumption that the data that is being represented with in them is correct and accurate. We need to make the distinction between data and capta the further our understanding of these visualizations. 
</p> <p>	
	Furthermore the use of traditional graphs are not always the best way to display data from the digital humanities fields and by altering them we are able to present the wider variety of information. While creating graphs that are untraditional it can cause some difficulty when reading them but are a better way to express capta. There is the complication of the users ability to read the graph and by creating new graphs the communication of this graph is less effective. 
 </p> <p>
	In order to communicate the information being presented, it is important to consider both the format being used and that data being presented. Within the following quote from Christof Schöch article Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? Data in the Humanities we are able to see that the bias of the data can also alter the information being given.</p> <p>
	“underlining the idea that even the very act of capturing data in the first place is oriented by certain goals, done with specific instruments, and driven by a specific attention to a small part of what could have been captured given different goals and instruments. In other words, capturing data is not passively accepting what is given, but actively constructing what one is interested in.”</p> <p>
	To further my understanding of this concept I tried to create a graph out of this article to show that the visualization technique could alter the information being presented. When I inputted the article into the Volant visualization tool I was given a variety of different graphs.  This allowed me to see how authors could choose one graph over the other in order to support their point. By doing so they are not technically manipulating the data just only showing a specific viewpoint of that data that better supports their view.</p> <p>

Above are two different graphs and it is easy to see how you could misrepresent data if you chose one over the other.  For example if you are trying to show how much these articles used the word “data” choosing graph 0.1 would be beneficial as the word data is large and bold. where in graphs 0.2 data is just centred and shown to have a stronger affinity with the other words. Therefore by using graphs 0.1 the data is being represented in a way that is benefiting the author.</p> <p>
	Within Bethany Nowviskie article neatline & visualization as interpretation it can be seen that she has created a digital storytelling tool. This function of this is to be able to map information that is not stable and express information that is subjective. </p> <p>
	“Its timelines and drawing tools are respectful of ambiguity, uncertainty, and subjectivity, 		and allow for multiple aesthetics to emerge and be expressed. The platform itself 			is architected so as to allow multiple, complementary or even wholly conflicting 			interpretations to be layered over the same, core set of humanities data. This data is 			understood to be unstable (in the best sense of the term) – extensible, never fixed or 		complete – and able to be enriched, enhanced, and altered by the activity of the scholar or 		curator”</p> <p>
	These types of visualizations should be used more in the digital humanities in order to remove the bias associated with traditional visualization techniques in order to improve transparency with the reader and leading to a clearer understanding of the information and recognize the subjective nature of that information. Leveraging a visualization technical bettern suited to the humanistic view allows the reader to interpret the data instead of having the data interpreted for them. </p>
